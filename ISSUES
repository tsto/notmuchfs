notmuchfs - A virtual maildir file system for notmuch queries
=============================================================

Notmuchfs is free software, released under the GNU General Public
License version 3 (or later).

This is v0.1, so there are many unimplemented features and rough edges. Some of
them are listed here.


Bugs:
-----

- Sometimes see 'rename: No such file or directory (errno = 2)' from mutt. Why?

- Anything that creates new messages or modifies the content of existing ones
  will not work. This doesn't seem to break anything with mutt except
  break-thread/join-thread (which want to mknod() new message files and write
  altered content into them).

- Sometimes see segfault in Xapian::Document::Internal::open_term_list() called
  from notmuchfs_open() (with notmuch 0.11 at least, have not seen it since).
  Is it gone?

- Sometimes see abort in ChertTable::set_overwritten() called from
  Xapian::Database::get_document() (with xapian 1.2.12, notmuch 0.14), only
  seen it once.


Mis(sing)-features:
-------------------

- Currently notmuchfs searches for individual messages, not threads. Is a
  threads search useful? How to fit it into the 'directory name is query'
  model?

- Currently if the notmuch database contains duplicate message IDs, notmuchfs
  only shows one message. Perhaps display them all somehow? Probably not worth
  the effort.

- The X-label header is forwarded within the mail verbatim, if MIME forwarding
  is used. Can the MUA be changed to ignore them? It doesn't look like mutt
  can, without a patch.

- Various buffy-esque ways of checking for new mail inside a virtual maildir,
  perhaps involving mtime of cur/ dir. Can notmuchfs change this to indicate
  new mail in a sensible way?

- Current munging of virtual maildir file names is not strictly to maildir
  spec. Since # is allowed in maildir file names, s,/,#, is not OK, although it
  doesn't seem to fail for anyone yet.

- Notmuchfs doesn't show up in 'df' output. Use the '-a' option to 'df' if you
  must.



Ideas:
------

- An IMAP or POP server could run on top of notmuchfs easily. What would make
  this more useful?
